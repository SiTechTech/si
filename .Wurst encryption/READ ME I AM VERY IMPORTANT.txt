DO NOT SHARE THESE FILES WITH ANYONE!
They are encryption keys that protect your alt list file from being read by someone else.
If someone is asking you to send these files, they are 100% trying to scam you.

DO NOT EDIT, RENAME OR DELETE THESE FILES! (unless you know what you're doing)
If you do, Wurst's Alt Manager can no longer read your alt list and will replace it with a blank one.
In other words, YOUR ALT LIST WILL BE DELETED.
